\section*{Exercise 3}
Let $\pi_{X,Y} (x, y)$ be the density of a distribution of interest. We recall that the systematic scan Gibbs sampler proceeds as follows to sample from $\pi_{X,Y}$.

\textbf{Systematic Scan Gibbs sampler.} Let $X^{(1)}, Y^{(1)}$ be the initial state then iterate for $t = 2, 3, \ldots$
\begin{itemize}
\item Sample $Y^{(t)} \sim \pi_{Y |X}\left(\cdot| X^{(t-1)}\right)$.
\item Sample $X^{(t)} \sim \pi_{X|Y}\left(\cdot| Y^{(t)}\right)$.
\end{itemize}

The random scan Gibbs sampler is an alternative algorithm which proceeds as follows to sample from $\pi_{X,Y}$.

\textbf{Random Scan Gibbs sampler.} Let $X^{(1)}, Y^{(1)}$ be the initial state then iterate for $t = 2, 3, \ldots$
\begin{itemize}
\item Sample $J \in \{1, 2\}$ where $P (J = 1) = P (J = 2) = 1/2$.
\item If $J = 1$, sample $Y^{(t)} \sim \pi_{Y |X}\left(\cdot| X^{(t-1)}\right)$ and set $X^{(t)} = X^{(t-1)}$.
\item If $J = 2$. Sample $X^{(t)} \sim \pi_{X|Y}\left(\cdot| Y^{(t-1)}\right)$ and set $Y^{(t)} = Y^{(t-1)}$.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Give the expression of the transition kernel density $K^S_{X,Y} ((x, y),(x', y'))$ of the Markov chain $\{X^{(t)}, Y^{(t)}\}_{t\geq1}$ generated by the systematic Gibbs sampler as a function of $\pi_{X|Y}$ and $\pi_{Y |X}$. Show that $K^S_{X,Y}$ is not reversible with respect to $\pi_{X,Y}$.

\item Show that the sequence $\{X^{(t)}\}_{t\geq1}$ associated to the systematic scan Gibbs sampler is a $\pi_X$-reversible Markov chain and give the expression of its associated transition kernel density $K^S_X (x, x')$ as a function of the two ``full'' conditional densities $\pi_{Y |X}$ and $\pi_{X|Y}$.

\item Give the expression of the transition kernel density $K^R_{X,Y} ((x, y),(x', y'))$ of the Markov chain $\{X^{(t)}, Y^{(t)}\}_{t\geq1}$ generated by the random scan Gibbs sampler as a function of $\pi_{X|Y}$ and $\pi_{Y |X}$. Show that $K^R_{X,Y}$ is $\pi_{X,Y}$-reversible.
\end{enumerate}
